It has 120 bass/chord buttons, 41 piano keys (17 inch keyboard – a full size accordion  is around 19 inches) Three sets of treble reeds. All the reeds are playing but will benefit from some tuning, especially the right hand middle pitch reeds M + M+. The bass & chord reeds are pretty good for the age of the accordion. Most of the leather reed valves are in good working order & lying flat against the reed plates. Ideally all reeds would be rewaxed & revalved but this could be done at a later date if required. 1 x metal bellow corner is missing (not leaking air) The bass coupler is not working properly, a full repair for this would mean removing the bass action for access, but a temporary easy repair can be made to the mechanism near the bass reed blocks. There is a piece of decorative plastic moulding missing from around the treble registers. Some ‘Sonola’ name letters missing. Comes with case (a bit tatty) & padded shoulder straps. FREE UK mainland delivery. We would advise that you need some experience in accordion repair before attempting something of this quality.

This outstanding accordion truly is a world class instrument, and really has to be played to be fully appreciated. Meticulously hand crafted in the Italian town of Castalfidardo by the highly skilled artisans of the internationally renowned Bugari factory, this incredible full size “Bayan” convertor would be ideal for a professional player, or indeed the discerning amateur who simply wants the best. The Bugari Bayan Activa Compact is one of the very top models currently produced by the Bugari factory, and is painstakingly crafted over a period of several months using only the finest materials and the very best hand made reeds. Despite featuring the full selection of 120 bass buttons and a huge right hand range of 45 treble keys, the accordion is a “compact” model due to a slightly narrower treble key width, meaning that it is a bit smaller and lighter than many full size Bayan instruments from other makers. With the reeds arranged in a four voice double octave layout, and a very narrow tremolo tuning, this model is really set up for the high end classical and jazz styles of playing, and also boasts a double cassotto chamber on the eight foot clarinet and sixteen foot bassoon reeds, which help to produce a wonderfully warm and mellow tone. The instrument is also fitted with a convertor mechanism, giving it the ability to switch between free bass and stradella bass systems at the touch of a button, as well as multiple chin coupler switches for ease of use. This particular example is only eight years old, and was originally ordered new from the factory for a very high flying student at the Royal Academy of Music, who has looked after it well and had it regularly serviced and maintained. Finished in a very attractive high gloss black casework, and presented for sale in very good overall general condition throughout.
