The Krugerrand is now one of the most recognised gold coins among collectors and investors alike.After its conception at the end of the '60s, the Krugerrand was being minted at a rate of approximately 40,000 units per year, this continued to grow until 1978 when a record-breaking 6 million coins were produced.The Krugerrand was given the status of legal tender in South Africa, which is why it is minted in 22ct gold (91.67% purity) in order to make the coin more durable. The remaining metal in the coin is copper, making the Krugerrand slightly red in colour.","Code
